# 30 Days of Python Challenge

Welcome to the **30 Days of Python Challenge**! This repository contains my journey to mastering Python for data analysis, where I commit to learning and practicing Python every day for 30 days.

## About the Challenge

The **30 Days of Python Challenge** is a personal initiative aimed at enhancing my skills in Python, specifically for data analysis. Each day, I focus on learning a new topic or concept and apply it through hands-on coding exercises, which will be documented and shared here.

## Objectives

- To reinforce my understanding of Python programming.
- To gain practical experience in using Python libraries for data analysis.
- To complete 30 consecutive days of learning and coding.
- To share my progress and insights daily on LinkedIn.

## Repository Structure

This repository is organized as follows:

```

    ├── README.md    # Overview of Day 30
    └── main.py      # Code for Day 30's exercises
```

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/xDweeb/30-days-of-python
    ```

2. Navigate to the desired day's folder and open `main.py` to view or execute the code for that day.

3. You can follow along by reviewing the daily README files, which provide a summary of the concepts covered each day.

## Daily Progress

Each day, I will:

- Learn a new Python concept or tool.
- Apply the concept through exercises or projects.
- Document my learning and share my progress on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/xdweb).

### Topics Covered

Throughout this challenge, I will cover a range of topics, including but not limited to:

- Python basics and syntax
- Data structures (lists, dictionaries, etc.)
- Loops and conditionals
- Functions and modules
- File handling
- Libraries for data analysis: `Pandas`, `NumPy`, etc.
- Data visualization with `Matplotlib` and `Seaborn`
- Working with CSV, JSON, and APIs
- Basic machine learning concepts

## Requirements

To follow along or run the code in this repository, you'll need:

- Python 3.x installed on your machine.
- Basic knowledge of Python is recommended.
- The following Python libraries installed (these will be used in later lessons):

    ```bash
    pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
    ```
