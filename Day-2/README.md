Python Booleans
Booleans represent one of two values: True or False.

Most Values are True
Almost any value is evaluated to True if it has some sort of content.

Any string is True, except empty strings.

Any number is True, except 0.

Any list, tuple, set, and dictionary are True, except empty ones.

Some Values are False
In fact, there are not many values that evaluate to False, except empty values, such as (), [], {}, "", the number 0, and the value None. And of course the value False evaluates to False.

Example
The following will return False:

bool(False)
bool(None)
bool(0)
bool("")
bool(())
bool([])
bool({})

Python Operators

Operator	Name	Example
+	Addition	x + y	
-	Subtraction	x - y	
*	Multiplication	x * y	
/	Division	x / y	
%	Modulus	x % y	
**	Exponentiation	x ** y	
//	Floor division	x // y


Python Assignment Operators

Operator	Example	
=	x = 5	x = 5	
+=	x += 3	x = x + 3	
-=	x -= 3	x = x - 3	
*=	x *= 3	x = x * 3	
/=	x /= 3	x = x / 3	
%=	x %= 3	x = x % 3	
//=	x //= 3	x = x // 3	
**=	x **= 3	x = x ** 3	
&=	x &= 3	x = x & 3	
|=	x |= 3	x = x | 3	
^=	x ^= 3	x = x ^ 3	
>>=	x >>= 3	x = x >> 3	
<<=	x <<= 3	x = x << 3	
:=	print(x := 3)	x = 3
print(x)


Python Comparison Operators
Comparison operators are used to compare two values:

Operator	Name	Example	Try it
==	Equal	x == y	
!=	Not equal	x != y	
>	Greater than	x > y	
<	Less than	x < y	
>=	Greater than or equal to	x >= y	
<=	Less than or equal to	x <= y



Python Logical Operators
Logical operators are used to combine conditional statements:

Operator	Description	Example	
and 	Returns True if both statements are true	x < 5 and  x < 10	
or	Returns True if one of the statements is true	x < 5 or x < 4	
not	Reverse the result, returns False if the result is true	not(x < 5 and x < 10)

Python Identity Operators

Operator	Description	Example	
is 	Returns True if both variables are the same object	x is y	
is not	Returns True if both variables are not the same object	x is not y


Python Membership Operators
Operator	Description	Example	
in 	Returns True if a sequence with the specified value is present in the object	x in y	
not in	Returns True if a sequence with the specified value is not present in the object	x not in y

Python Bitwise Operators
Bitwise operators are used to compare (binary) numbers:

Operator	Name	Description	Example	
& 	AND	Sets each bit to 1 if both bits are 1	x & y	
|	OR	Sets each bit to 1 if one of two bits is 1	x | y	
^	XOR	Sets each bit to 1 if only one of two bits is 1	x ^ y	
~	NOT	Inverts all the bits	~x	
<<	Zero fill left shift	Shift left by pushing zeros in from the right and let the leftmost bits fall off	x << 2	
>>	Signed right shift	Shift right by pushing copies of the leftmost bit in from the left, and let the rightmost bits fall off	x >> 2

The precedence order is described in the table below, starting with the highest precedence at the top:

Operator	Description	Try it
()	Parentheses	
**	Exponentiation	
+x  -x  ~x	Unary plus, unary minus, and bitwise NOT	
*  /  //  %	Multiplication, division, floor division, and modulus	
+  -	Addition and subtraction	
<<  >>	Bitwise left and right shifts	
&	Bitwise AND	
^	Bitwise XOR	
|	Bitwise OR	
==  !=  >  >=  <  <=  is  is not  in  not in 	Comparisons, identity, and membership operators	
not	Logical NOT	
and	AND	
or	OR	
If two operators have the same precedence, the expression is evaluated from left to right.
