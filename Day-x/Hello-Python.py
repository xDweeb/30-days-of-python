# create a variable called color with an appropriate value on the line below
# (Remember, strings in Python must be enclosed in 'single' or "double" quotes)

color = "Blue"

pi = 3.14159 # approximate
diameter = 3

# Create a variable called 'radius' equal to half the diameter
raduis = diameter / 2

# Create a variable called 'area', using the formula for the area of a circle: pi times the radius squared
area = pi * raduis ** 2
